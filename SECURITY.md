# Reporting Security Issues

The Arcentra Authors. and community take security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your report and address issues promptly.

## How to report a vulnerability

Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories.

- Go to the GitHub repository **Security** tab and click **Report a vulnerability**.
- Direct link (if available): `https://github.com/arcentrix/arcentra/security/advisories/new`

Alternative: if you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, you may report by email to `support@arcentra.io`.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue and its impact
- Affected versions (if known)
- Reproduction steps / proof-of-concept (if possible)
- Any suggested remediation or mitigation

## Our response process

- We will acknowledge your report and share next steps as soon as possible.
- After the initial reply, we will keep you informed about progress towards a fix and coordinated disclosure.
- We may request additional details to help validate and remediate the issue.

## Third-party dependencies

If the vulnerability is in a third-party dependency, please also consider reporting it to the upstream maintainers. If you are unsure, you can still report it to Arcentra and we will help triage.
