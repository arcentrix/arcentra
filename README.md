> **A Cloud-Native CI/CD Control Plane and Automation Hub**

Arcentra is an open-source, cloud-native **CI/CD control plane** designed to orchestrate pipelines, schedule agents, and unify automation workflows at scale.

Rather than being another pipeline runner, Arcentra focuses on providing a **stable architectural center** for modern engineering systems — enabling teams to build, evolve, and govern their CI/CD and automation practices over time.

---

## ✨ Project Vision

Modern engineering environments are increasingly complex: repositories multiply, pipelines fragment, and execution environments diversify. While tools are abundant, **a unifying control layer is often missing**.

Arcentra aims to fill this gap by acting as a **central coordination layer** for CI/CD and automation systems.

Arcentra is designed for teams who:

* Operate multiple repositories and pipelines
* Require distributed agent / runner execution
* Care about observability, auditability, and governance
* Want a long-lived platform rather than a short-term tool

---

## 🧠 Name Origin

**Arcentra** is derived from two roots:

* **Arc** — Architecture, Flow, Lifecycle
* **Centra** — Center, Control, Hub

Together, the name represents:

> **An architectural center for orchestrating engineering workflows**

## 🏗️ Core Capabilities

Arcentra is built around a small set of durable abstractions:

* **Pipeline Orchestration**

  * Multi-stage, conditional, and DAG-based workflows
  * Decoupled pipeline definition and execution

* **Agent Scheduling**

  * Centralized control with distributed execution
  * Support for heterogeneous environments and resource pools

* **Control Plane Architecture**

  * Unified modeling of pipelines, executions, and state
  * Designed for platform-level governance

* **Observability and Auditing**

  * Native integration with logging, tracing, and metrics
  * End-to-end visibility into workflow execution

* **Extensibility**

  * API-first and plugin-oriented design
  * Easy integration with existing build, deploy, and ops tooling

## 🌐 Cloud-Native by Design

Arcentra embraces cloud-native principles:

* Kubernetes-native runtime model
* Horizontally scalable agents
* Deep integration with modern observability stacks
* Suitable as a long-term engineering platform

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* Organization-wide CI/CD platforms
* Multi-cluster or multi-cloud build and delivery systems
* Teams evolving from tool-based pipelines to platform governance
* Engineering organizations seeking consistency and visibility

---

## 🚧 Project Status

Arcentra is currently under **active development**. The project prioritizes:

* Clear and stable core abstractions
* Extensibility and long-term maintainability
* Practical integration with real-world engineering systems

Contributions, discussions, and design feedback are welcome.
